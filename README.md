# Typeer - WPM in your status bar

This is something I wanted... how fast am I typing at a given time?

So I made this to show up in the menu bar, so I can glance up and see how I'm doing generally.

It's totaly not accurate, and it's hacky as hell. But there you go. Hope you enjoy it.


Please feel free to hack the source and do whatever you want with it. It's really simple right now.
